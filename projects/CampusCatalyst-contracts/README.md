# Campus Crowdfunding Platform - Smart Contracts

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Algorand blockchain for campus projects, clubs, and student initiatives. This smart contract enables transparent, secure fundraising with escrow functionality.

## 🎯 Features

- **Campaign Creation**: Students can create campaigns with title, description, goal amount, deadline, and images
- **Transparent Contributions**: Accept contributions in ALGO with full transparency
- **Escrow Mechanism**: Funds released only if goal is met by deadline
- **Refund System**: Automatic refunds if campaign goal is not reached
- **Campaign Management**: Update campaign details, cancel campaigns, track progress
- **Box Storage**: Efficient on-chain storage for campaign data

## 🏗️ Smart Contract Architecture

The contract uses Algorand's box storage for efficient data management and includes:

- `create_campaign()` - Create new crowdfunding campaigns
- `contribute()` - Contribute ALGO to campaigns
- `withdraw_funds()` - Withdraw funds after successful campaign
- `claim_refund()` - Claim refund if goal not met
- `get_campaign_info()` - Retrieve campaign details
- `update_campaign()` - Update campaign information
- `cancel_campaign()` - Cancel campaign (before contributions)

### Initial Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

#### 2. Install Pre-requisites
Ensure the following pre-requisites are installed and properly configured:

- **Docker**: Required for running a local Algorand network. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- **AlgoKit CLI**: Essential for project setup and operations. Install the latest version from [AlgoKit CLI Installation Guide](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli#install). Verify installation with `algokit --version`, expecting `2.0.0` or later.

#### 3. Bootstrap Your Local Environment
Run the following commands within the project folder:

- **Install Poetry**: Required for Python dependency management. [Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Verify with `poetry -V` to see version `1.2`+.
- **Setup Project**: Execute `algokit project bootstrap all` to install dependencies and setup a Python virtual environment in `.venv`.
- **Configure environment**: Execute `algokit generate env-file -a target_network localnet` to create a `.env.localnet` file with default configuration for `localnet`.
- **Start LocalNet**: Use `algokit localnet start` to initiate a local Algorand network.

### Development Workflow

#### Terminal
Directly manage and interact with your project using AlgoKit commands:

1. **Build Contracts**: `algokit project run build` compiles all smart contracts. You can also specify a specific contract by passing the name of the contract folder as an extra argument.
For example: `algokit project run build -- hello_world` will only build the `hello_world` contract.
2. **Deploy**: Use `algokit project deploy localnet` to deploy contracts to the local network. You can also specify a specific contract by passing the name of the contract folder as an extra argument.
For example: `algokit project deploy localnet -- hello_world` will only deploy the `hello_world` contract.

#### VS Code 
For a seamless experience with breakpoint debugging and other features:

1. **Open Project**: In VS Code, open the repository root.
2. **Install Extensions**: Follow prompts to install recommended extensions.
3. **Debugging**:
   - Use `F5` to start debugging.
   - **Windows Users**: Select the Python interpreter at `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe` via `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` > `Python: Select Interpreter` before the first run.

#### JetBrains IDEs
While primarily optimized for VS Code, JetBrains IDEs are supported:

1. **Open Project**: In your JetBrains IDE, open the repository root.
2. **Automatic Setup**: The IDE should configure the Python interpreter and virtual environment.
3. **Debugging**: Use `Shift+F10` or `Ctrl+R` to start debugging. Note: Windows users may encounter issues with pre-launch tasks due to a known bug. See [JetBrains forums](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-277486/Shell-script-configuration-cannot-run-as-before-launch-task) for workarounds.

## AlgoKit Workspaces and Project Management
This project supports both standalone and monorepo setups through AlgoKit workspaces. Leverage [`algokit project run`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/project/run.md) commands for efficient monorepo project orchestration and management across multiple projects within a workspace.

## AlgoKit Generators

This template provides a set of [algokit generators](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/generate.md) that allow you to further modify the project instantiated from the template to fit your needs, as well as giving you a base to build your own extensions to invoke via the `algokit generate` command.

### Generate Smart Contract 

By default the template creates a single `HelloWorld` contract under campus_funding folder in the `smart_contracts` directory. To add a new contract:

1. From the root of the project (`../`) execute `algokit generate smart-contract`. This will create a new starter smart contract and deployment configuration file under `{your_contract_name}` subfolder in the `smart_contracts` directory.
2. Each contract potentially has different creation parameters and deployment steps. Hence, you need to define your deployment logic in `deploy_config.py`file.
3. `config.py` file will automatically build all contracts in the `smart_contracts` directory. If you want to build specific contracts manually, modify the default code provided by the template in `config.py` file.

> Please note, above is just a suggested convention tailored for the base configuration and structure of this template. The default code supplied by the template in `config.py` and `index.ts` (if using ts clients) files are tailored for the suggested convention. You are free to modify the structure and naming conventions as you see fit.

### Generate '.env' files

By default the template instance does not contain any env files. Using [`algokit project deploy`](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/project/deploy.md) against `localnet` | `testnet` | `mainnet` will use default values for `algod` and `indexer` unless overwritten via `.env` or `.env.{target_network}`. 

To generate a new `.env` or `.env.{target_network}` file, run `algokit generate env-file`

### Debugging Smart Contracts

This project is optimized to work with AlgoKit AVM Debugger extension. To activate it:
Refer to the commented header in the `__main__.py` file in the `smart_contracts` folder.

If you have opted in to include VSCode launch configurations in your project, you can also use the `Debug TEAL via AlgoKit AVM Debugger` launch configuration to interactively select an available trace file and launch the debug session for your smart contract.

For information on using and setting up the `AlgoKit AVM Debugger` VSCode extension refer [here](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-avm-vscode-debugger). To install the extension from the VSCode Marketplace, use the following link: [AlgoKit AVM Debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=algorandfoundation.algokit-avm-vscode-debugger).
